# Planning Poker

The Planning Poker Game is a popular agile game that is used to estimate the time required for various tasks and prioritize them based on their value to the project. The game is played using a deck of cards, with each card representing a different number of story points. Story points are a unit of measure used in agile development to estimate the relative size and complexity of a task or user story.

Here's how the game works:

1. The facilitator presents a list of tasks or user stories that need to be estimated.

2. The team members each receive a deck of cards with numbers representing different story points (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100).

3. The facilitator presents the first task or user story and reads out a description of the task.

4. Each team member selects a card from their deck that represents the number of story points they believe the task or user story represents.

5. Once all team members have selected a card, they reveal their cards at the same time.

6. If there is a consensus on the estimate, the estimate is recorded and the next task or user story is presented. If there is disagreement, the team members discuss the reasons behind their estimates and the facilitator may present additional information to help clarify the task or user story.

7. Steps 4-6 are repeated for each task or user story.

Once all estimates have been recorded, the team can use them to plan the project and prioritize the tasks based on their value and complexity. The Planning Poker Game helps to promote collaboration and consensus-building within the team, and can be adapted to suit different levels of experience and skill in agile methodology.

## Sample Task List

- Implement login functionality
- Create user registration form
- Design homepage layout
- Add search functionality
- Integrate payment gateway

- Create user profile page
- Implement email notification system
- Improve website performance

These tasks can be customized to suit the needs of the project or team. It's also important to ensure that the tasks are small enough to be estimated accurately and that they represent value to the project or product being developed. Additionally, the tasks should be specific enough to be understood by all team members and facilitate productive discussion during the game.
