## Online resources

* exercism.io, Euler Problems & other code challenges
* YouTube & other video resources
* Docs & Readme
* Books/blogs on the frameworks or other programming wisdom

## Purpose

* Writing clean code
* To question the purpose and value of a feature
* To find better ways of doing the same feature
* To become craftsman - learning how to learn better
* Ability to learn and teach others
* Collaborate on solving problems vs being a lone wolf
* Quality & best practices
* Learning about the remaining 80% - code is only 20% of the problem

# Structure

## Week 1, 2 (Remote) - 4 hours/day [40 hours]

- Individualistic approach
- Learn syntax, write your first "Hello, World!"
- Get familiar with being mentored by complete strangers
- Learning to rewrite and rework code

**For Trainers:**

- Identifying individual strengths and weaknesses
- Tailoring week 3, 4 based on the feedback from week 1, 2 output

## Week 3, 4 (Classroom) - 10-12 hours / day x 7 days / week [140-168 hours]

- 4-6 hours of classroom activities and coaching
- Familiarize with the technology - frameworks, ecosystem, resources, limitations
- Familiarize with feature scoping, sizing and understanding the hands-on project requirements
- Reading technical literature - Books & other resources related to the upcoming project
- Presenting and sharing learning on the technical literature
- Team bonding and encouraging collaboration
- Finding innovative ways of coping with the stress
- Daily feedback and health check

**For Trainers:**
- Project scoping and basic setup - this can start as early as week 1
- Getting familiar with the problem domain and identifying strong stakeholders
- Performing an inception activity where individual features are scoped & de-scoped
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines along with deployment

## Week 4-8 (Hands-on) - 6-8 hours / day [120-160 hours]

**Statement:** We live in a fast-paced changing technological landscape, being up-to-date on the different approaches to solving the same problem provides a distinct advantage.

- Trainees will be split into 2 teams (Day 0)
- Release management and setting up CI/CD pipelines (Day 0)
- Deployment management and identifying the best places to deploy on (Day 0)
- Pair programming, testing and code refactoring will be encouraged
- Minimal use of external libraries
- Open source most of the output
- Individual one-on-one sessions to help the individual cope up
- Fostering team collaboration - the herd is as fast as the individual
- OSS will be read and built on top of
- Ability to solve existing issues in OSS libraries of their choice
- Contributing to documentation and BNBR policies will be enforced
- Daily stand-ups - not status meetings
- Understanding the project velocity and scoping or descoping some features will be a crucial activity for each individual
- Code reviews and dev hurdles to brainstorm on hard technical challenges
- Use Auth0 or Firebase to skip authentication - This avoids spending too much time on user role setup if building a web app

# Ideal candidate ideas for project

- In the space of IoT, utility programs, scraping tools, slack bots, NLP, non-native mobile development, web app development
- Open source or throw-away projects
- Internal tools and applications
- Green field projects or projects which aren't behind by more than 1 major version - no need of mucking around with old tech cause finding relevant resource becomes hard
- Approach local NGOs to identify and solve their problems
- Tools and libraries useful for a few client projects
- Building a SASS product on top of existing open source libraries
