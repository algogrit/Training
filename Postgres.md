# PostgreSQL Training Course guidelines

## Prerequisites
  https://www.elephantsql.com/ or local installation
  https://www.pgadmin.org/ or psql

## Course Structure
- What is a table, row, column?
- Managing a table (CREATE, ADD, REMOVE)
- Basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
- Foreign key references
- Indices
- Joins (LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER, UNIONS)

## Intermediate topics
- Dealing with Big Data >1 GB
- ETL in Postgres (COPY, EXTRACT, Triggers & Views)
- Storing Time Series Data in Postgres
- PostgreSQL admin configuration (This includes optimization strategies for different workloads)
- Using Postgres as a document store

## Advanced topics
- Optimizing a query using EXPLAIN
- Window functions
- Clusters, Replication and Sharding
- Partitioning

All this will be a hands-on workshop with a toy use-case. I can structure the content as either a 2-day/3-day course (sans advanced topics) or a 7-day course spread over a few weeks to cover in-depth knowledge of PostgreSQL. We can discuss further on this. The course can be redesigned based on the familiarity and the level of understanding of participants.
